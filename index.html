            <h3>Become a risk taker!!</h3>
            <p>Dreaming big means having the mental freedom to think about what you really want out of life and forget
                about all the reasons why you can't make it a reality. ... Someone could use dreaming big to motivate
                themselves to see the bigger picture of what they really want in life</p>
